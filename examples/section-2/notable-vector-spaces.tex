\begin{example}
    Some notable examples of vector spaces are:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\set{R}^n$, the set of $n$-tuples of real numbers
        \item $\set{C}^n$, the set of $n$-tuples of complex numbers
        \item $\mathbb{P}_n$, the set of polynomials having degree less or equal to $n$
        \item $C^n([a, b])$, the set of real (or complex)-valued functions continuous on $[a, b]$ up to their $n$-th derivative, $n \in [0, \infty)$
    \end{itemize}
