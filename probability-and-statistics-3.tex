\subsection{Predictive function models}

ML aims at constructing functions to predict the behaviour of new data from the behaviour of training data. These functions are called \textit{predictive functions or predictors}.

They can be:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item a deterministic function
    \item a probabilistic model
\end{enumerate}

The models depend on \textit{parameters} that are estimated in the \textit{training phase}.

\subsubsection{Model as a function}

In the first case, we must determine a function 
$$f:\mathbb{R}^D \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}$$
